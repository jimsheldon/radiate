radiate - utomated internet radio

Currentlyt this project is very inflexible and undocumented.  I'm writing it
for an internet radio station that I'm working on.

What each file does:

generate_playlist.sh: Generates a playlist from a directory.

getsong.sh: Read by station.liq at every song change.

logsong.sh: Log meta data to a file.

show_end.sh: Kicked off by cron at the end of every show.

stats.sh: Generate statistics from logs, kicked off by cron.

watch_dirs.sh: Watch directories for file additions.

station.liq: Liquidsoap script.
